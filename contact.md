You can find me on <a rel="me" href="https://types.pl/@jw">Mastodon</a>, <a rel="me" href="https://github.com/9nine9nine9">GitHub</a>, or <a rel="me" href="https://linkedin.com/in/jacobjwalters">LinkedIn</a>.

I can also be emailed at the address
generated from this Haskell program:

```hs
map succ "vdal`rsdq?i`bnav`ksd-qr"
```

(this obfuscation is to mitigate email scaping bots)

I do not use PGP at this time.
