                <h1>About</h1>
                <h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<p>I am a fourth and final year student of Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh.</p>
<p>In the past, I’ve worked with <a href="https://denotational.co.uk/">Ohad Kammar</a> on implementing an ML-style module system for <a href="https://idris-lang.org/">Idris 2</a>, a dependently typed language.
We also worked together on a <a href="https://github.com/idris-bayes/monad-bayes">probabilistic programming DSL/library</a> in Idris, with an accompanying <a href="https://github.com/idris-bayes/melocule">probabilistic music composition tool</a>.</p>
<p>I also co-founded <a href="https://typesig.comp-soc.com">TypeSig</a>, a student special interest group at UoE, which aims to get undergraduates interested in theoretical computer science.
TypeSig runs weekly Lean workshops and regular academic talks (from the likes of <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/">Phil Wadler</a>, <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/">John Baez</a> and <a href="https://www.ma.ic.ac.uk/~buzzard/">Kevin Buzzard</a>).
We also ran our very own <a href="https://typesig.comp-soc.com/pages/dt2024/index.html">lecture series</a> and <a href="https://typesig.comp-soc.com/tuple/">conference</a>!</p>
<p>My main academic interests lie in
programming language theory (PL),
type theory,
quantum computing,
and category theory.</p>
<p>Outside of the nerd life, I enjoy synthesizers (both playing and making them), reading, and eclectic (read: bad) music.
In order to truly fit the PL stereotype, I’ve recently taken up climbing.</p>
<p>Here’s a map of countries I’ve been to:

<h2 id="about-this-site">About this site</h2>
<p>You can read in detail about how this site is made in <a href="posts/2023-05-12-website.html">this post</a>, but the gist is: this site is generated from a set of Org files using <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a> (and <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>), and served to you via Github Pages.</p>
<p>I’ve used literate programming to document the <a href="./static/style.html">CSS</a> and <a href="./static/js.html">JS</a> for this site. The actual <code class="verbatim">.css</code> and <code class="verbatim">.js</code> files are generated directly from the previously linked pages.</p>
<p>You can also browse this site entirely from within Emacs using Org mode! Find out how <a href="posts/2023-05-17-serving-websites-over-org.html">here</a>.</p>
