                <h1>About</h1>
                <h3 id="about-me">About Me</h3>
<p>I am a first year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, researching programming language theory (PL) under the supervision of <a href="https://denotational.co.uk/">Dr. Ohad Kammar</a>.
I also did my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Mathematics here.</p>
<p>In the past, I’ve worked with Ohad on implementing an ML-style module system for <a href="https://idris-lang.org/">Idris 2</a>, a dependently typed language.
We also worked together on a <a href="https://github.com/idris-bayes/monad-bayes">probabilistic programming DSL/library</a> in Idris, with an accompanying <a href="https://github.com/idris-bayes/melocule">probabilistic music composition tool</a>.</p>
<p>In 2023, I co-founded <a href="https://typesig.pl">TypeSig</a>, a student special interest group at UoE, which aims to get undergraduates interested in theoretical computer science.
TypeSig runs weekly Lean workshops and regular academic talks (from the likes of <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/">Phil Wadler</a>, <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/">John Baez</a> and <a href="https://www.ma.ic.ac.uk/~buzzard/">Kevin Buzzard</a>).
We also ran our very own <a href="https://typesig.pl/resources/domain-theory">lecture series</a> and <a href="https://typesig.pl/tuple/">conference</a>!
I also developed and ran a <a href="https://typesig.pl/resources/lang-workshop">tutorial series</a> teaching first year students how to implement a functional programming language called MLTS.</p>
<p>My main academic interests lie in
programming language theory (PL),
type theory,
quantum computing,
and category theory.</p>
<p>Outside of research, I enjoy synthesizers (both playing and making them), reading, and listening to and making music.
In order to truly fit the PL stereotype, I’ve recently taken up climbing.</p>
<p>Here’s a map of countries I’ve been to:

<h3 id="about-this-site">About this Site</h3>
<p>You can read in detail about how this site is made in <a href="./posts/website.html">this post</a>, but the gist is: this site is generated from a set of Org files using <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a> (and <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>), and served to you via Github Pages.</p>
<p>I’ve used literate programming to document the <a href="./static/style.html">CSS</a> and <a href="./static/js.html">JS</a> for this site. The actual <code class="verbatim">.css</code> and <code class="verbatim">.js</code> files are generated directly from the previously linked pages.</p>
<p>You can also browse this site entirely from within Emacs using Org mode! Find out how <a href="./posts/serving-websites-over-org.html">here</a>.</p>
