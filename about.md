## About me
I am a third-year student of
Computer Science and Mathematics
at the University of Edinburgh.

I'm working with
[Ohad Kammar](https://denotational.co.uk/)
on implementing a probabilistic music composition library
in [Idris2](https://idris-lang.org/),
a dependently-typed language.

My interests in CS areas are in
programming language theory,
type theory,
probabilistic programming
compiler design,
operating systems and low level computing,
and hardware synthesis.
I'm also interested in cyber security,
though mainly as a hobby.

My mathematical intrigues lie mostly in
category theory,
cryptography,
and abstract algebra,
and of course in logic as well.

Outside of the nerd life, I enjoy
synthesizers (playing and making them),
reading,
and eclectic (read: bad) music.


## About this site
This site is generated
from a set of markdown files using
[Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/)
(and [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)),
and served to you using
[Scotty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/scotty) and
[Warp](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/warp).
It's hosted on a VPS from
[Contabo](https://contabo.com).
I thoroughly recommend all of these.

The CSS I'm currently using is
a modified
[tufte-css](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/).
This allows for the nice side and margin notes
you can see throughout my site.
To aid writing with this, I use
[pandoc-sidenote](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc-sidenote)
in my pandoc compiler to convert
standard markdown footnote syntax
into sidenotes and margin notes.

Any code snippets on this site are
released into the public domain,
except where otherwise noted.
All art assets are my copyright,
except where otherwise noted.
